Visualizing origin-destination data with temporal features
is a common task and multiple approaches have been used.

Guo~et~al.~\cite{Guo2006} use an origin-destination matrix
to show companies relocating within the US.
Rows and columns can be reordered to identify clusters
and patterns, and therefore provide no spatial context.
Also, the resolution of origins and destinations is limited
to states due to the use of a matrix.
In order to address those spatial problems
Wood~et~al.~\cite{Wood2002} explore nested matrices
that are laid over a geographic map.
Every cell of the matrix aggregates the origins
of the geographic map and contains
a second matrix showing aggregated destinations of
a smaller scale version of the map.
Becker~et~al.~\cite{Becker1995} compare
origin-destination matrices to node-link representations
and propose a dynamic node-link representation
where the user can define time intervals to aggregate the data,
set thresholds to limit the number of visible links,
and choose the regions that are displayed.

Using a node-link representation for showing origin-destination
data introduces clutter for large data-sets.
Holten and van Wijk~\cite{Holten2009} use edge bundling
to overcome clutter. However, this may imply hierarchical
relations of flows which do not exist.
Rae~\cite{Rae2009} use heat-maps based on
the density of migration flow of cities in the UK.
The user can also select a city to see its flow as node-links.
By computing density based clusters to define regions
Guo~et~al.~\cite{Guo2012} use choropleth maps to show
the net-flow of taxis in Hong Kong.
A kernel density representation shows the distribution
of destinations.
The same technique is used by Ferreira~et~al.~\cite{Ferreira2013}
for both destinations and origins.
